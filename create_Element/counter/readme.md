# 🔢 Simple Counter Web App
This is a minimalistic counter web application created using HTML, Bootstrap 5, and Vanilla JavaScript. Each time the "Add" button is clicked, a new number is appended to the existing display.

## 🚀 Features
A counter starts at 0.

On each click of the "Add" button:

The counter value increases by 1.

The new count is added as a span element to the display area.

## 🧠 How It Works
The count variable keeps track of the number of clicks.

When the button is clicked:

JavaScript increments count.

A new <span> element with the updated number is created and added to the <p> tag (#counter).

The result is a growing list of numbers inside the paragraph.

## 📁 Project Structure
index.html      → Contains the layout and Bootstrap integration

script.js       → Handles the counting logic using JavaScript

## 🌐 Technologies Used
HTML5

Bootstrap 5

JavaScript (ES6)

## 📌 Note

Currently, each new number is appended next to the previous one, making it grow horizontally. You can customize the display to replace the number instead, if desired.
