and many more...

## 🧠 How It Works
Quotes are stored in an array of objects, each containing:

**id**: unique identifier

**quote**: the quote text

**author**: the name of the person who said it

When the user clicks the Next button:

The script accesses the next quote using an index.

Updates the <p> tags for both quote and author using textContent.

## 📁 File Structure

index.html      → Contains the HTML structure with button and display areas

script.js       → Contains the logic and quote data

## 💡 Possible Improvements
