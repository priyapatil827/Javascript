# 💬 Inspirational Quotes Web App
This is a simple Quotes Display Web Application built using HTML and Vanilla JavaScript. It dynamically displays a collection of inspirational, philosophical, and motivational quotes by various famous authors.

## 🚀 Features
Displays a curated list of 30+ quotes from authors like:

Rumi

Abdul Kalam

Mother Teresa

Albert Einstein

Muhammad Ali

Aristotle

Walt Disney and more!

Each quote includes the text and its respective author.

Automatically rendered using JavaScript on page load.

## 🧠 How It Works
The JavaScript file contains an array of objects named quotes, where each object includes:

An id

A quote (text)

An author

The script:

Loops through each quote.

Creates new HTML elements (<div>, <p>) for the quote and the author.

Appends them into the main .container in the HTML document.

## 📁 Project Structure

index.html       → Contains the HTML layout and container div

script.js        → Contains the quote array and logic to display them

## 🌐 Technologies Used
HTML5

JavaScript (ES6)

## 💡 Possible Enhancements
Add a "Next Quote" button to show one quote at a time.

Add filters (e.g., by author).

Style the quotes using CSS or Bootstrap.

Implement animations or transitions for smoother rendering.
