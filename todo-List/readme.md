# 📝 Simple To-Do List Web App
This is a basic To-Do List web application built using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap 5), and JavaScript. It allows users to add items to a to-do list dynamically and displays them on the screen. Each item includes a "Delete" button for future implementation.

## 🚀 Features
Add new tasks to the list by typing and clicking the "Add" button.

Displays a default list of tasks on page load.

Dynamically updates the list with each new entry.

Built using Bootstrap for a clean, responsive layout.

## 📁 Project Structure

index.html      → Main HTML file with structure and Bootstrap linked

script.js       → JavaScript logic for managing the to-do list

## 🔧 How It Works
The user enters a task in the input field and clicks the "Add" button.

JavaScript captures this input and adds it to the todos array.

The display() function dynamically creates and displays each task with a "Delete" button (currently not functional).

The initial list includes predefined tasks like "Wake up 5pm", "Workout", etc.

## 💡 Future Improvements
Implement the "Delete" functionality to remove individual tasks.

Add local storage support to persist tasks.

Improve UI with icons or animations.

## 🌐 Technologies Used
