# 📝 Simple Note/To-Do App
This is a basic Note/To-Do List web application built using HTML, CSS (via Bootstrap), and JavaScript. It allows users to add, delete, and edit notes using the DOM (Document Object Model) without any external backend or storage.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Add new notes/tasks

🗑️ Delete existing notes

✏️ Edit notes easily

📱 Responsive layout using Bootstrap

⚡ Dynamic DOM manipulation with vanilla JavaScript

## 🧰 Technologies Used
HTML5

CSS3 (Bootstrap 5)

JavaScript (DOM manipulation)

## 📂 File Structure

│
├── index.html         # Main HTML file
├── script.js          # JavaScript logic for the app
└── README.md          # Project description and setup instructions
## 💡 How It Works
User types a note into the input field.

Pressing the "Add" button adds the note to the list.

Each note has Edit and Delete buttons.

Delete removes the note.

Edit loads the note back into the input box for updating.
