# 🧾 Project Title:
jQuery Number Counter Display

## 📄 Description:
This is a simple web-based counter application built with HTML, JavaScript, and jQuery.
The application prompts the user to enter a number, and then it displays a count from 1 up to that number in a <p> tag, updating every second using setInterval.

## 🔧 Features:
Takes number input from the user via prompt()

Uses jQuery to update the text content inside the <p>element

Counts up from 1 to the entered number, one number per second

Demonstrates DOM manipulation and timed updates

## 🖥️ How It Works:
User is asked to enter a number when the page loads.

A counter starts from 1.

Every 1 second, the current number is shown in the paragraph <p id="p">

The counting stops automatically once it reaches the user's number.
